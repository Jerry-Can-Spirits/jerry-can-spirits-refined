    title: "The Signals Mission",
    description: `My world used to be one of frequencies and encryption. As a soldier in the Royal Corps of Signals, the mission was to deliver crystal-clear communication in the most demanding environments on Earth. In that world, "close enough" was never an option. Every signal had to be perfect, every connection flawless. Our motto was <em>Certa Cito</em>—'Swift and Sure.' It wasn't just a phrase; it was the standard I lived by.`,

  {
    title: "A New Distillation",
    description: `When I left the service, I carried that ethos with me. The discipline, meticulous attention to detail, and calm focus under pressure are principles that stay with you. I found a new mission in the art of distillation, seeing a clear parallel between the precision of engineering a global communications link and the craft of creating a perfectly balanced spirit. Both are a blend of art and science; both demand a relentless pursuit of excellence.`,

    title: "The Spirit of Adventure",
    description: `That is the source of Jerry Can Spirits. It’s a rum forged from a veteran's experience and engineered with the lessons I learned in service. It’s a tribute to the iconic jerry can—a symbol of rugged reliability that travelled with us on every operation. But more than that, it’s a tribute to the spirit of resourcefulness and quiet confidence that gets any job done, whether that’s establishing a connection or crafting the spirit you’re holding today. This is the new standard for your next adventure.`,
